          We live in a noisy age. The average person checks their smartphone 80-120 times per day. There's a supercomputer in virtually every pocket. While great for keeping us connected, it's allowed to interrupt us and consume our time. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Time... it's limited these days. And it is tough stay productive. Think of all the unnecessary notifications, spam emails, and endless scrolling though social networks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Silo sets out to solve this by giving you the power to unplug and focus at any given time. This challenge-reward system is what designers, creatives, and programmers already use to be more productive.

          Silo Focus uses the Apple Watch taptic engine to tap you on the wrist and guide you though your timebox. The subtlety of a tap on the wrist makes Silo Focus an ideal companion in and out of the workplace. It's informative, discreet, instant, and lets you operate hands, eyes, and ears-free. Not to mention, itâ€™s always by your side as a constant reminder. This incredible experience is the future of productivity and we're excited to share it with you. We hope you'll support us on this evolutionary journey.
