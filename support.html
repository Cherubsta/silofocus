		      <p style="font-size: 24px; color: #F6A623;">If you are having trouble with SILO please consider the following solutions:</p>
		    </div>
		    <ol>
		      <li>If the app is not showing up on your Apple Watch or in the Watch App on your iPhone, try power cycling your WATCH then your iPhone.</li><br>

		      <li>For trouble with notifications: delete the SILO app <b>from your iPhone</b>, make sure it's off your WATCH, then reinstall from the App Store <a href="https://appsto.re/us/PROWab.i">here</a>.</li><br>
		      
		      <li>To force quit an app on WATCH: hold down the Dock button, when power-off menu appears, hold down the Crown button.</li><br>
		      
		      <li>Make sure you are running the latest versions of iOS, watchOS, and of course SILO.</li><br>
		      
		      <li>Be sure Notifications are Allowed: from iPhone go to Settings > SILO > Notifications > turn on allow notifications. From the Watch app, go to Notifications > SILO switch on. Also, scroll down and switch ON again to mirror alerts from iPhone.</li><br>
		      
		      <li>If your WATCH is loose on your wrist, it may accidentally lock (you may see a blue lock symbol on the top the of watch screen). When it's locked, notifications cannot go through.</li><br>
		      
		      <li>SILO will not work if iPhone/Watch is in "Do Not Disturb" mode (it <em>will</em> work in Airplane Mode).</li><br>
		      
		      <li>Consider increasing Haptic Strength: from WATCH go to Settings > Sounds &amp; Haptics > increase Haptic Strength. Or turn on "Prominent Haptics" for an extra tap.</li><br>
		      
		      <li>If you are using Bluetooth headphones via WATCH during a session, it could suppress the haptics.</li><br>
		      
		      <li>And if those don't work: delete SILO app, then restart and/or restore WATCH and iPhone.</li><br>
