          <li>Delete SILO app from iPhone</li>
          <li>Make sure it’s also removed on Watch</li>

          <li>Restart WATCH</li>
          <li>Install SILO from App Store again <a href="https://appsto.re/us/PROWab.i">(link here)</a></li>
          <li>Install SILO on WATCH (from iPhone's Watch App) - it may take a few minutes to show up on watch</li>
          <li>Open SILO app on iPhone, swipe through the intro, and when prompted Allow Notifications (if not prompted, got to Settings > Notifications > SILO)</li>
          <li>This method has been successful, when done in that order</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 style="margin-top: 2em">If the above method does not work, try the following tips:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Make sure you are running the latest versions of iOS, watchOS, and of course <a href="https://appsto.re/us/PROWab.i">SILO</a></li>
		      <li>To force quit an app on WATCH: hold down the Dock button, when power-off menu appears, hold down the Crown button</li>
		      <li>Be sure Notifications are Allowed: from iPhone go to Settings -> SILO -> Notifications -> turn on allow notifications. From the Watch app, go to Notifications -> SILO switch on. Also, scroll down and switch ON again to mirror alerts from iPhone</li>
		      <li>If your WATCH is loose on your wrist, it may accidentally lock (you may see a blue lock symbol on the top the of watch screen). When it's locked, notifications cannot go through</li>
		      <li>SILO will not work if iPhone/Watch is in "Do Not Disturb" mode -- (it <em>will</em> work in Airplane Mode)</li>
		      <li>Consider increasing Haptic Strength: from WATCH go to Settings -> Sounds &amp; Haptics -> increase Haptic Strength. Or turn on "Prominent Haptics" for an extra tap</li>
		      <li>If you are using Bluetooth headphones via WATCH during a session, it could suppress the haptics.</li>
		      <li>As a last resort, you may have to do a Restore and Backup of your WATCH</li>
